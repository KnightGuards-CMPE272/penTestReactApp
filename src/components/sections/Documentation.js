              KnightGuard is a PenTesting assistant tool that can be leveraged by Pen-Testers for preliminary analysis of the host to be PenTested. 
              It can be leveraged to find out all the services that are exposed in the host. KnightGuard will assist you in listing all the services along with the link to
              CVE Issues for that particular service.

              Access to scan and view the scan results are restricted. We are working on the auto Sign-up feature. However until then we are happy to add you as a Pen-Tester. 
              Please send out an email with your details to <a className="doc-email" href = "mailto: knightguards@emaildodo.com">knightguards@emaildodo.com</a> and we will set you all up.

             KnightGuard scan output will have 2 sections. A summary section and the details section. Summary section will give you information of how many ports are open and if the host is vulnerable at a very high level.
             There are 3 details section. First one will have all the information related to open ports, services running on those ports and also a link to CVE site listing out all CVEs related to the respective service and version number. 
             Second one is the RPC service section which will have all the RPC services in the host. Third one will be List of all URLs. This is useful for a penTester testing Web or Application server.

              How does Knightguard work? 
            </h3>
            <h10 className="reveal-from-bottom" data-reveal-delay="200">
              KnightGuard accepts the hostName or IP from user. It performs a series of preliminary scans on the host to find any vulnerable port and services exposed.
              Once we have the list of services we will performs scans on these services to find out any potential issues. Once the scan is completed you will have all the preliminary 
              information on host vulernabilities or weakness which can be leveraged to exploit and perform focused PenTesting. In the below figure we have depicted the 
              flow of information from KnightGuard to host. We store all the informaiton on the database so that it can be accessed later on. <br/><br/>

              We highly encourage any feedback on the tool. We are continously working to provide new features/capabilities to the tool.
